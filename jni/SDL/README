This is a SDL android transplanting project.

There's an origin README file of SDL which is renamed as SDL_README.

This is an underconstructing project and its stableness cannot be guaranteed.

And I'm working on the android transplanting and it's not done yet.

This README would be a walk through document, and definately a verbose one, kinda like a working log. When finished, I would write a more decent README file and a walk through document.

------------------------

This SDL version is SDL-2.0.0-6302 which is obtained at http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php and I'm using android-NDK-r7b.

Currently the transplanting work refers to this document: http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL/README.android, which indicates that one should use the "android-project" folder to use SDL along with android-NDK.


--#
Folder android-project:
/
	AndroidManifest.xml
	build.properties
	build.xml
	default.properties
	local.properties
	jni/
	res/
	src/

which looks exactly like an android project with native code. Initially, the jni/ looks like this:
jni/
	src/
		Android.mk	/* with: SDL_PATH := ../SDL */
	Android.mk	/* with only: include $(call all-subdir-makefiles) */

So it means there exists jni/SDL/ and the SDL shared library build rules is in this folder. So I copied SDL-2.0.0-6302/SDL to SDL-2.0.0-6302/android-project/jni/

With the ffmpeg transplanting experience, I don't like using this way to port SDL because it makes me feel clumsy. I prefer build SDL shared library first, and then use NDK PREBUILD-SHARED-LIBRARY to link to the built shared library.

And now I'm giving it a try. (2012-03-06)

--#
Build-Shared-Library

working directory: SDL-2.0.0-6302/SDL/

There's also an android-project folder in here, and I'm guessing this is because SDL2.0 is underconstruction right now. It seems the same as the initiate $SDL/android-project.

Two Make function:
subst: $(subst a,b,c), replace all the "a" in "c" with "b"
wildcard: $(wildcard PATTERN), all files that match PATTERN
Reference (Chinese):
http://www.linuxsir.org/main/doc/gnumake/GNUmake_v3.80-zh_CN_html/make-08.html

So the /Android.mk::LOCAL_SRC_FILES could be considered as all those files matching these PATTERNs, removing "$(LOCAL_PATH)/";

recall the main transplanting document (http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL/README.android), the Instruction 2 said "Move this SDL directory into the <project>/jni directory", so I'm guess I've made a mistake here. 

I should use the SDL-2.0.0-6302 folder instead of the SDL-2.0.0-6302/SDL/. So I DELETE the SDL-2.0.0-6302/android-project/jni/SDL/, which builds library "SDL", while the root folder Android.mk builds library "SDL2". The java code loads "SDL2" library, which indicates that I'm right.

So I use SDL-2.0.0-6302/Android.mk, SDL-2.0.0-6302/src and SDL-2.0.0-6302/include to try to build a shared library. That is, I've got:
(new folder)/jni/
	Android.mk
	src/
	include/
ERROR FLOOD. Too naive. Things are just not right.
